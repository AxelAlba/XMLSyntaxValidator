# :computer:XML Syntax Validator
Used for hackerrank's competition regarding the creation of a lexical analyzer and a syntax analyzer for checking if a certain XML File is valid.

# :notebook:Notes
* The input for this would be a multi-line, consisting of the XML file you want to validate. However, it would only work 
using hackerrank's custom input as the input there is limited to the one you have submitted on the input box, as oppose to the endless empty space generated by entering in the command prompt.
